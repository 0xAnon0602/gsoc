# List of ideas for projects

## Information for Students

These ideas were contributed by current IHR contributors. They are sometimes vague or incomplete. 
If you wish to submit a proposal based on these ideas, you are urged to contact the related person 
and find out more about the particular suggestion you're looking at.

Becoming accepted as a Google Summer of Code student is quite competitive. 
Accepted students typically have thoroughly researched the topic of their proposed project and have been in frequent contact with potential mentors. 
Simply copying and pasting an idea here will not work. 
On the other hand, creating a completely new idea without first consulting potential mentors rarely works.

That said, these are just proposals, we are open to new ideas you might have!
Do you have an awesome idea you want to work on with IHR but that is not among the ideas below? 
That's cool. We love that! 
But please get in touch with a mentor early on and make sure your project is realistic and within the scope of IHR.

If there is no specific contact given you can ask questions at ihr-admin@iij-ii.co.jp.
